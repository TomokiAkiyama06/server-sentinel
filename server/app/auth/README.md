# Human Authorization

Owns owner invitations/allowlists, independent `live:view` and `recordings:view` permissions, owner-only operations, and prompt revocation.

- Accepts Tailscale/trusted-proxy identity only through a non-bypassable local listener boundary; ordinary LAN clients cannot supply trusted identity headers directly.
- Requires application authorization in addition to private-network reachability. Tailnet membership alone grants no access.
- Keeps historical events/timeline under `recordings:view` and provides generic, non-branding denial for uninvited identities.
- Does not modify Tailscale ACLs/Grants, store Tailscale administrative credentials, or treat an agent identity as a human/admin identity.
