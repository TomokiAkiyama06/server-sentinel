# Presence and Timeline Core

This module persists neutral, attributed observations and projects the four
presence states: `PRESENT`, `PROBABLY_PRESENT`, `ABSENT`, and `UNKNOWN`.

It is deliberately an integration core, not a human-facing API or an
authentication implementation. `Access` is injected: the default denies every
Owner and historical-timeline operation. Until Issue #10 supplies the reviewed
application authorization boundary, no production timeline, override, or audit
route may be registered from this module.

Its integration ports keep the dependent stack explicit:

- Issue #24 supplies confirmed server-movement and camera-tamper observations.
- Issue #25 supplies quality-gated, confirmed Owner entry/exit observations;
  this module never compares biometric data or selects a confidence threshold.
- Issue #21 supplies storage admission, evidence preservation, and configured
  notification workers. Side effects are durably queued and dispatched outside
  the database write transaction.
- Issue #10 supplies Owner and `recordings:view` authorization before any
  future human route delegates here.

Manual overrides require an injected, audited Owner identity and take
precedence over observation and schedule hints. Only a trusted, confirmed,
quality-sufficient Owner entry can project `PRESENT`; untrusted timing and
insufficient quality remain `UNKNOWN`. Critical movement/tamper observations
always queue evidence and configured notification work regardless of presence.
Timeline ordering uses receipt order and explicitly reports degraded timing if
clock trust or source ordering is unavailable. It reports observations and
their temporal context only; it never infers cause, guilt, or identity.
