# Main Server release lifecycle

Development commands in `FOUNDATION.md` run from a mutable checkout. A stable
deployment instead uses the versioned archive and installer described here. Do
not point a production service at a Git clone.

## Release artifact

Use a supported CPython and download the exact reviewed wheels from
`requirements.lock` into an otherwise empty wheelhouse. Build from a tagged
release checkout:

```sh
cd server
python3 -m pip download --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: --no-deps \
  --dest /tmp/server-sentinel-wheelhouse -r requirements.lock
python3 build_artifact.py --version 1.0.0 \
  --wheelhouse /tmp/server-sentinel-wheelhouse \
  --output /tmp/server-sentinel-main-1.0.0.tar.gz
python3 build_installer.py \
  --output /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.0.0.pyz
```

The archive contains only the Main Server package, reviewed lock and license
material, and supplied wheelhouse. It contains no checkout history, tests,
deployment configuration, credentials, or runtime data. Publish its reported
SHA-256 separately with the versioned release. The installer verifies that
outer digest, the manifest version, every member digest, and the bounded
regular-file archive shape before executing release code. Publish the reported
installer SHA-256 as well; the installer zipapp contains only standard-library
installer/configuration code plus project license material and runs without a
repository checkout.

## One-time deployment preparation

Create a dedicated non-root account and an Owner-selected runtime filesystem.
Create `state`, `recordings`, and `audit` directories on it; all four directories
and the configuration file must be private and owned by the service account.
The installer never creates these paths and never substitutes the checkout,
installation tree, or a directory left on the root filesystem by a missing
mount.

The private JSON configuration has this shape (values are examples, not
deployment defaults):

```json
{
  "runtime_root": "/srv/example-filesystem/server-sentinel",
  "runtime_mount_point": "/srv/example-filesystem",
  "runtime_device": [8, 1],
  "service_uid": 991,
  "human_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "human_port": 8000,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

Record `runtime_device` as the decimal Linux major/minor numbers for the
Owner-approved mounted filesystem. The mount point must contain the runtime root
and resolve to that same device. This pins startup against a missing mount that
leaves a directory behind. Keep actual paths, device identity and UID private. A
loopback literal is mandatory for the human listener; expose it through the
separately configured trusted private proxy after application authorization is
available.

## Install, update, and rollback

Run the separately downloaded installer only after verifying its published
SHA-256. Global arguments precede the operation:

```sh
sudo /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.0.0.pyz \
  --destination /opt/server-sentinel-main \
  --config /etc/server-sentinel/deployment.json \
  --unit /etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service \
  install --version 1.0.0 \
  --artifact /tmp/server-sentinel-main-1.0.0.tar.gz --sha256 <published-sha256>

sudo /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.1.0.pyz \
  --destination /opt/server-sentinel-main \
  --config /etc/server-sentinel/deployment.json \
  --unit /etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service \
  update --version 1.1.0 \
  --artifact /tmp/server-sentinel-main-1.1.0.tar.gz --sha256 <published-sha256>

sudo /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.1.0.pyz \
  --destination /opt/server-sentinel-main \
  --config /etc/server-sentinel/deployment.json \
  --unit /etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service rollback
```

`--unit` accepts exactly `/etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service`. Using one
canonical administrator unit prevents another systemd search path from selecting
a different definition when the installer restarts the logical service.

Each release gets its own virtual environment under `releases/<version>`.
Dependencies install offline from the artifact with hashes and binary-only
enforcement. Root-only environment construction accepts only an absolute,
root-controlled interpreter and runs Python isolated from the invoking directory
and inherited `PYTHON*` environment. Preflight runs as the dedicated account.
`current` and `previous`
are atomically replaced relative symlinks; a failed update restart restores and
restarts the prior release. Rollback defaults to `previous`, or accepts an
already installed `--version`. Releases and runtime data are never deleted by
these operations. Database migrations are forward-only, so an older application
may reject a newer database; that failed rollback restores the release that was
running before the attempt.

The generated systemd unit runs without capabilities as the dedicated account,
gives write access only to the runtime root, checks mount/config before every
start, and invokes the loopback-enforcing launcher. It uses `Type=notify`; the
launcher sends readiness only after ASGI lifespan/database migration and Uvicorn
listener startup both succeed. `systemctl restart` therefore remains pending or
fails rather than accepting a merely spawned process. Enabling the unit at boot
remains an explicit administrator action. Install the Ubuntu package providing
`venv` for the selected Python before the first release operation; the installer
fails closed if it cannot create the per-release environment.

There is currently no implemented or documented Docker Compose deployment path.
Adding one requires the same external runtime mount, pinned mount failure,
dedicated identity, private listener, version update, and rollback contract;
`infra/docker/README.md` is only a future integration boundary.
