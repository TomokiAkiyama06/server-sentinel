# Main Server release lifecycle

Development commands in `FOUNDATION.md` run from a mutable checkout. A stable
deployment instead uses the versioned archive and installer described here. Do
not point a production service at a Git clone.

## Release artifact

Use a supported CPython and download the exact reviewed wheels from
`requirements.lock` into an otherwise empty wheelhouse. Build from a tagged
release checkout:

```sh
cd server
python3 -m pip download --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: --no-deps \
  --dest /tmp/server-sentinel-wheelhouse -r requirements.lock
python3 build_artifact.py --version 1.0.0 \
  --wheelhouse /tmp/server-sentinel-wheelhouse \
  --output /tmp/server-sentinel-main-1.0.0.tar.gz
python3 build_installer.py \
  --output /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.0.0.pyz
```

The archive contains only the Main Server package, reviewed lock and license
material, and supplied wheelhouse. It contains no checkout history, tests,
deployment configuration, credentials, or runtime data. Publish its reported
SHA-256 separately with the versioned release. The installer verifies that
outer digest, the manifest version, every member digest, and the bounded
regular-file archive shape before executing release code. Publish the reported
installer SHA-256 as well; the installer zipapp contains only standard-library
installer/configuration code plus project license material and runs without a
repository checkout.

## One-time deployment preparation

Create a dedicated non-root account and an Owner-selected runtime filesystem.
Create `state`, `recordings`, and `audit` directories on it; all four
directories must be private and owned by the service account. The installer
never creates these paths and never substitutes the checkout, installation tree,
or a directory left on the root filesystem by a missing mount.

The configuration file itself is administrator-managed, not runtime data. Place
it in an administrator-controlled directory outside the installation tree and
outside the runtime root, owned by `root`, in a directory whose every path
component is root-owned and not writable by others unless it is sticky. Give it group read for the service account's group
and nothing more, for example `root:server-sentinel` with mode `0640`. The
runtime account must be able to read it and must never be able to rewrite it; a
world-readable, group-writable, service-owned, or runtime-root-resident
configuration is refused.

The JSON configuration has this shape (values are examples, not deployment
defaults):

```json
{
  "runtime_root": "/srv/example-filesystem/server-sentinel",
  "runtime_mount_point": "/srv/example-filesystem",
  "runtime_device": [8, 1],
  "runtime_filesystem_uuid": "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444",
  "service_uid": 991,
  "human_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "human_port": 8000,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

`runtime_filesystem_uuid` is the Owner-approved filesystem UUID, resolved
through `/dev/disk/by-uuid`. It is the stable runtime-filesystem identity:
reformatting or swapping the disk changes it even when the mount path, the
directory layout and the Linux device numbers are reused, so the replacement is
refused instead of written to. Read it with `lsblk -no UUID <device>` or
`blkid`, and record it only in this private configuration.

`runtime_device` records the decimal Linux major/minor numbers of the same
filesystem. It corroborates the UUID and catches a missing mount that leaves a
directory behind, but it can never replace the UUID because a replacement disk
can reuse the same numbers. The mount point must contain the runtime root and
resolve to that same device, and the runtime filesystem must not be the
operating-system root filesystem or backed by its device.

Keep actual paths, filesystem identity and UID private. A loopback literal is
mandatory for the human listener; expose it through the separately configured
trusted private proxy after application authorization is available.

## Install, update, and rollback

Run the separately downloaded installer only after verifying its published
SHA-256. Global arguments precede the operation:

```sh
sudo /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.0.0.pyz \
  --destination /opt/server-sentinel-main \
  --config /etc/server-sentinel/deployment.json \
  --unit /etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service \
  install --version 1.0.0 \
  --artifact /tmp/server-sentinel-main-1.0.0.tar.gz --sha256 <published-sha256>

sudo /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.1.0.pyz \
  --destination /opt/server-sentinel-main \
  --config /etc/server-sentinel/deployment.json \
  --unit /etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service \
  update --version 1.1.0 \
  --artifact /tmp/server-sentinel-main-1.1.0.tar.gz --sha256 <published-sha256>

sudo /tmp/server-sentinel-installer-1.1.0.pyz \
  --destination /opt/server-sentinel-main \
  --config /etc/server-sentinel/deployment.json \
  --unit /etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service rollback
```

`--unit` accepts exactly `/etc/systemd/system/server-sentinel.service`. Using one
canonical administrator unit prevents another systemd search path from selecting
a different definition when the installer restarts the logical service.

Each release gets its own virtual environment under `releases/<version>`.
Dependencies install offline from the artifact with hashes and binary-only
enforcement. Root-only environment construction accepts only an absolute,
root-controlled interpreter and runs Python isolated from the invoking directory
and inherited `PYTHON*` environment. Preflight runs as the dedicated account.
`current` and `previous`
are atomically replaced relative symlinks; a failed update restart restores and
restarts the prior release. Rollback defaults to `previous`, or accepts an
already installed `--version`. Both release pointers and the service unit move
inside one guarded transaction: a failure at any point restores both pointers and
the previous unit and restarts the release that was running before the attempt.
One service-global lock covers each whole install, update, and rollback, so
overlapping administrator invocations are serialized rather than interleaved.

Releases and runtime data are never deleted by these operations; only a staged
release whose own installation failed is removed. Database migrations are
forward-only, so an older application may reject a newer database; that failed
rollback restores the release that was running before the attempt.

Release trees therefore accumulate under the installation root. Keep the
installation filesystem separate from the runtime filesystem so release growth
cannot consume recording space, watch its free space, and prune an old release
directory only as a deliberate administrator action, never the release named by
`current` or `previous`. Pruning touches the installation filesystem only and
never state, recordings, or audit data.

The generated systemd unit runs without capabilities as the dedicated account,
gives write access only to the `state`, `recordings` and `audit` directories —
not to the runtime root itself, so the service cannot replace or remove them —
checks mount/config before every
start, and invokes the loopback-enforcing launcher. It uses `Type=notify`; the
launcher sends readiness only after ASGI lifespan/database migration and Uvicorn
listener startup both succeed. `systemctl restart` therefore remains pending or
fails rather than accepting a merely spawned process. Enabling the unit at boot
remains an explicit administrator action. Install the Ubuntu package providing
`venv` for the selected Python before the first release operation; the installer
fails closed if it cannot create the per-release environment.

Deployed acceptance of this lifecycle — systemd activation, the trusted-proxy
boundary, real mount substitution, and the recording/audit content comparison
across update and rollback — is recorded in `MANUAL_TEST.md` section V for Issue
#47. The synthetic tests in `server/tests/` do not establish it.

There is currently no implemented or documented Docker Compose deployment path.
Adding one requires the same external runtime mount, pinned mount failure,
dedicated identity, private listener, version update, and rollback contract;
`infra/docker/README.md` is only a future integration boundary.
